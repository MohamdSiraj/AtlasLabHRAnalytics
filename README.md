# HR Data Analysis using Power BI – Case Study: HR Analytics

A fictional software company named **AtlasLab** faced recurring challenges in interpreting high resignation rates and poor employee retention in certain departments, without clear analytical insights to help decision-makers. I embarked on this practical project to accurately analyze the situation and provide data-driven solutions to improve the work environment and HR strategies.

## Phase One – Building the Data Model and Exploratory Analysis

- Data was collected from various sources, cleaned, and structured to build a robust data model in Power BI.
- An exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the main features of the data and formulate initial hypotheses about the causes of turnover.

---

## Phase Two – Analysis of Demographic Factors and Job Disparities

- The analysis focused on demographic variables such as age, gender, and marital status to identify any patterns related to employee retention.
- Job disparities between departments were examined, including salary and job level, to uncover any significant differences that might affect employee stability.

## Phase Three – The Relationship Between Job Performance and Resignation

- The relationship between employee performance evaluation scores and their likelihood of resignation was analyzed.
- This helped to understand whether low-performers were more likely to leave, or if other factors were at play.

---

## Phase Four – Analysis of Service Duration, Work Hours, and Travel

- The impact of the length of service, overtime hours, and business travel requirements on employee retention was studied.
- This provided a deeper understanding of how work-life balance might influence an employee's decision to stay or leave.
